I am a Final Year Undergraduate at <a href=https://mnnit.ac.in>Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology</a> in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering advised by Supervisor <a href=http://www.mnnit.ac.in/images/newstories/2020/csed/NAVJOT_SINGH_MNNIT_M20.pdf>Prof. Navjot Singh</a>. My area of research is mainly in Systems and Networks. Im also working in Image Processing and Visual Cryptography even though they happen to be away from my research area. My primary research includes, Enchanced Security Architecture for Visual Cryptography based on Image Secret Sharing, which provides novel approach to Visual Cryptography, I had also worked under <a href=http://www.mnnit.ac.in/images/csedfp/mpandey/>Prof. Mayank Pandey</a> in the area of Operating Systems and Computer Networks, our work in area is,P2P SECURE VIDEO CONFERENCING AND LIVE STREAMING OVER INTERNET ENABLED DEVICES. I was fortunate enough to be given the oppurtunity to have state of the art starup incubator <a href=https://tqb.li2.in/thingqbator-mnnit>CISCO THINGQBATOR</a> at MNNIT, where i pitched my idea in the COHORT I and my project SMART n SECURE VEHICLE AUTOMATIC COLLISION DETECTION AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE got selected for mentorship and funding.
